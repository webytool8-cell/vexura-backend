# Manual Upload Asset Pack (50)

This folder contains 50 vector JSON files generated from - 
the prompts in `marketing/pinterest-batch.json` using the deterministic local generator logic.

## Upload steps
1. Open `/dashboard` in your app.
2. Drag/drop all `.json` files in this folder (exclude `manifest.json` and this README).
3. Upload order is prefixed in the filename (`01-...` to `50-...`).

## Notes
- These are local deterministic vectors intended as a manual-upload pack.
- Suggested prices from the original batch are listed in `manifest.json`.
