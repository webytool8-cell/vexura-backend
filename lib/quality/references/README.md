# Quality References

This folder contains high-quality visual references used to guide generation quality.

## Structure
- `icons/` – geometric, minimal icon references (monochrome, centered, safe-zone compliant).
- `illustrations/` – organic/scene references with smooth curves and balanced composition.

## Notes
- All assets are SVG and intentionally simple so they can be inspected and reused in prompt examples.
- Icon references follow the 400x400 canvas convention used across the pipeline.
